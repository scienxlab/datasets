# timeseries

A collection of signals, mostly from Matt Hall (2018), Time-frequency decomposition, _The Leading Edge_ **37** (6), p 468â€“470. DOI: [10.1190/tle37060468.1](https://doi.org/10.1190/tle37060468.1).

The microseismic recording is from [`timefreak`](https://github.com/kwinkunks/timefreak), a small collection of signals originally made by various authors at the _Latest developments in time-frequency analysis_ post-convention workshop organized by Mirko van der Baan, Sergey Fomel, and Jean-Baptiste Tary at the SEG Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado, on 30 October 2014. .
