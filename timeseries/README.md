## Timefreak

A small collection of signals originally made for [`timefreak`](https://github.com/kwinkunks/timefreak).

Some of these signals were compiled as benchmark signals by van der Bann, Tary, et al. for the _Latest developments in time-frequency analysis_ post-convention workshop organized by Mirko van der Baan, Sergey Fomel, and Jean-Baptiste Tary at the SEG Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado, on 30 October 2014. It's not clear how these are licensed, if at all.

- **`synthetic.txt`** &mdash; A toy synthetic signal.
- **`speech.txt`** &mdash; A laughing voice.
- **`tremor.txt`** &mdash; A volcano tectonic event, a gliding tremor (Redoubt Volcano on March 31, 2009; Hotovec et al. 2013).
- **`microseismic.txt`** &mdash; A microseismic event (Rolla hydraulic frack, 2011).
- **`tohoku.txt`** &mdash; A global earthquake signal (Tohoku 2011, Mw9).
- **`seismic-trace.txt`** &mdash; A seismic trace.
