# Canadaâ€“Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board

The CNSOPB distributes offshore data from Nova Scotia, Canada, including wells and seismic. The Penobscot data is probably the best known and can be [obtained from TerraNubis](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/Penobscot).

There are various smaller files in this repo, including wells, seismic, and horizons.

- D399, ALMA 3, Sable Island, UWI 303N764340060300, aka R-39. Useful for having shear sonic. (Note that ALMA 1 and ALMA 2 also have shear sonic, but the LAS files need merging.)
